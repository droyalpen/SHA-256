SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 256-bit (32-byte) fixed-length output, typically represented as a 64-character hexadecimal string. It is part of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family, designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
